Thanks for stopping by. This space will track my learning path from undergraduate foundations toward (hopefully) a future PhD in machine learning. Expect:

- Concept explainers (building intuition first)
- Paper distillations & reproduction attempts
- Weekly research / learning logs
- Experiment retrospectives (what failed & why)
- Personal reflections & milestones

If you're on a similar path, I hope the transparency (including the dead ends) helps.

_Onward!_

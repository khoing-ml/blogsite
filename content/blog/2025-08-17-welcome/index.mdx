Thanks for stopping by. This space will track my learning path from undergraduate foundations toward (hopefully) a future PhD in machine learning. Expect:
    - Concept explainers (building intuition)
    - Paper distillations & reproduction attempts
    - Weekly research / learning logs
    - Experiment retrospectives (what failed & why)
    - Personal reflections & milestones


If you're on a similar path, I hope the transparency (including the dead ends) helps.

``` python
print("hello world")
def hello():
```

```java
System.out.println("hello world");

```

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("hello world");
    return 0;
}
```
_Onward!_

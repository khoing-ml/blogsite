Store source Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) here. They are converted to MDX before publishing â€“ never commit large output cells (clear them first) to keep diffs clean.

Recommended workflow:
1. Draft experiment in notebook
2. Clean & clear outputs
3. Run conversion script to `content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-title/index.mdx`
4. Manually refine narrative in the generated MDX
